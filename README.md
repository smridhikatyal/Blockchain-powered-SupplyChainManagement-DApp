# Building a Blockchain Supply Chain Management DApp

🚀 Introduction

Supply chains today suffer from inefficiencies, fraud, and lack of transparency, leading to financial losses and trust issues. Our Blockchain-based Shipment Tracking DApp revolutionizes logistics by ensuring secure, immutable, and transparent tracking of shipments from sender to receiver. This decentralized approach eliminates intermediaries and enhances trust in global trade.

🛠️ Problem Statement

Traditional supply chains are prone to:

Lack of Transparency: Shipments can be altered or delayed without real-time tracking.

Fraudulent Activities: Intermediaries may tamper with the shipment details.

Payment Disputes: Delays in payment release, leading to inefficiencies.

Centralized Vulnerabilities: Single points of failure can disrupt operations.

🔥 How Our DApp Solves These Issues

Our Decentralized Shipment Tracking DApp addresses these challenges by utilizing Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to:
✅ Ensure Immutable Tracking: Every shipment record is stored permanently on the blockchain.
✅ Enable Trustless Transactions: Payments are locked in a smart contract and automatically released upon delivery confirmation.
✅ Prevent Tampering & Fraud: Data cannot be altered, ensuring authenticity.
✅ Remove Intermediaries: Eliminates unnecessary third-party involvement, reducing costs.
✅ Provide Real-time Status Updates: Track shipments at every stage without relying on centralized databases.

📜 Flow of the DApp

User Connects Wallet: The sender connects their MetaMask wallet to the DApp.

Create Shipment: Sender enters receiver details, distance, pickup time, and price.

Smart Contract Stores Data: Shipment details are stored on the blockchain.

Shipment Updates: The status updates as the shipment progresses.

Completion & Payment Release: Once delivery is confirmed, payment is automatically released to the receiver.
