# Building a Blockchain Supply Chain Management DApp

🚀 Introduction

      Supply chains today suffer from inefficiencies, fraud, and lack of transparency, leading 
      to financial losses and trust issues. Our Blockchain-based Shipment Tracking DApp 
      revolutionizes logistics by ensuring secure, immutable, and transparent tracking of 
      shipments from sender to receiver. This decentralized approach eliminates intermediaries 
      and enhances trust in global trade.

🛠️ Problem Statement

      Traditional supply chains are prone to:
      
      Lack of Transparency: Shipments can be altered or delayed without real-time tracking.
      
      Fraudulent Activities: Intermediaries may tamper with the shipment details.
      
      Payment Disputes: Delays in payment release, leading to inefficiencies.
      
      Centralized Vulnerabilities: Single points of failure can disrupt operations.

🔥 How Our DApp Solves These Issues

      Our Decentralized Shipment Tracking DApp addresses these challenges by utilizing Ethereum 
      blockchain and smart contracts to:
      ✅ Ensure Immutable Tracking: Every shipment record is stored permanently on the 
          blockchain.
      ✅ Enable Trustless Transactions: Payments are locked in a smart contract and 
          automatically released upon delivery confirmation.
      ✅ Prevent Tampering & Fraud: Data cannot be altered, ensuring authenticity.
      ✅ Remove Intermediaries: Eliminates unnecessary third-party involvement, reducing costs.
      ✅ Provide Real-time Status Updates: Track shipments at every stage without relying on 
          centralized databases.

📜 Flow of the DApp

      User Connects Wallet: The sender connects their MetaMask wallet to the DApp.
      
      Create Shipment: Sender enters receiver details, distance, pickup time, and price.
      
      Smart Contract Stores Data: Shipment details are stored on the blockchain.
      
      Shipment Updates: The status updates as the shipment progresses.
      
      Completion & Payment Release: Once delivery is confirmed, payment is automatically released to the receiver.
